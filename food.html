    <h1>Traditional Food in pakistan Famous Dishes You Have To Try</h1>
    <div class="payeee">
        <h2>1 . Payee</h2>
        <p>Paye is a favorite dish amongst Pakistanis. This traditional dish includes the hooves of goats, sheep, or
            even buffalos, which are slow-cooked with different spices to make gravy. Enjoyed with naan or khameeri
            rotis, Paye is often loved by most as a breakfast dish as well.
        </p>
        <img src="/blog_portal/payee.jpg" alt="">
        <p>
            f you love Paye, well, you have to try out <strong>Phajjay Ke Paye</strong> if you still haven’t. Again,
            going back to the
            walled city of Lahore, located in Kali Beri Bazaar,<strong>“Phajja Siri Paye”</strong> is well known across
            the city. It is
            a streetfood style restaurant, so you probably need to bear that in mind before going there for dine-in –
            but just remember that the taste is 100% worth the trip and sit in. The reason Phajja is so famous is
            because of the perfect blend of spices and slow-cooked trotters that make it taste soft and delicious.
            You’ve got to try it yourself to know that it is definitely worth the hype!
        </p>

        <h2>2 . Nihari</h2>
        <p>If you haven’t tried Nihari yet, this is your sign to do so. Nihari is a traditional dish that was loved by
            the Mughal Emperors, a meal they would enjoy as a morning meal after their morning prayers. It includes
            slow-cooked meat and stew, flavored with spices that have an effect of a burst of flavors in your mouth. The
            meat of Nihari is so tender, it literally melts in your mouth the moment you ingest it, so trust us when we
            say you have to try it. </p>
        <img src="/blog_portal/nihari.jpg" alt="">
        <p>

            <strong>Waris Nihari,</strong> located on Abkari Road in Anarkali (old Lahore) has made a name for itself.
            This is also a
            roadside dhabba/restaurant that offers seating on the street for you to sit and enjoy their delicious Nihari
            and
            khasta (fresh) naan or khameeri roti. Nihari is topped off usually with ginger, cilantro, and even lemon
            according to your liking. The experience here is great, if you want to try authentic Lahori Nihari – you
            won’t
            be disappointed.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you’re looking to try this stew dish somewhere closer inside the city, then Muhammadi Nihari comes at a
            very close second to Waris Nihari. <strong>Muhammadi Nihari</strong>Muhammadi Nihari has quite a lot of
            branches across Lahore, including
            Johar Town, Gulberg, and several spots in DHA. Their Beef Fry Nihari is one you should definitely try!
        </p>

        <h2>4. Channa</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Googa Murgh Channay</strong> is extremely famous as well. Murgh Channa is a dish that includes
            chicken slow-cooked with chickpeas to form a gravy full of traditional spices, once again, enjoyed with naan
            or khameeri roti, whichever is your preference. People of Lahore crave this dish and enjoy it at Googa
            Naqeebia in Model Town because as you’ve probably guessed, they have the best Murgh Channay in town! They
            serve these as breakfast so make sure you reach there on time and let your mind be blown away by the taste
            of this beloved dish.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Haleem</h2>
        <p>
            Thick, creamy, meatiness garnished with fried onions, ginger, juicy lemons, coriander, and whatnot. You will
            find the best haleem in Lahore at <strong>Haji Sultan Ahmed and Kozi Haleem</strong> at Regal Chowk.
        </p>
        <img src="/blog_portal/haleem.jpg" alt="">
        <hr>
        <h2>6. Daal Chawal</h2>
        <p>
            Now apart from all the meat-based dishes we’ve told you about, let’s move towards something simpler… Daal
            Chawal. Daal is a lentil-based dish that Lahoris enjoy heartily with rice. The best Daal Chawal can be found
            at Lakshmi Chowk in Lahore, under the name <strong>“Kashmiri Daal Chawal”</strong> . Fresh daal, soft rice,
            served with kebabs if you prefer – a wonderful lunch to enjoy when you’re craving something simple.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Pathoray</h2>
        <p>
            Another food street item that adds to the traditional dishes served at Lahore, Pathoray is a breakfast item
            that is enjoyed usually with chollay (similar to channay/chickpeas) and achaar (mixed pickle). You can enjoy
            Pathoray at Anarkali in Old Lahore at Kaka Pathoray wala, which specializes in Pathoray specifically, or
            even from <strong>Lahore Shahi Pathoray </strong> in Icchra Bazaar.
        </p>
        <img src="/blog_portal/pathoray.jpg" alt="">
        <hr>
        <h2>9. Korma</h2>
        <p>
            This is yet another traditional dish loved by all, and we bet you’ll love it too. Korma is a kind of curry,
            with a yogurt base cooked with different spices, with added chicken or meat. The usual preference is Mutton
            Korma, and if you don’t mind mutton, then you ought to try the Korma at <strong>Khan Baba
                restaurant</strong> . It is located at Lower Mall, Niaz View Sanda, and is a big restaurant with a hall
            accommodating families as well. So it’s not street food, don’t worry! It’s a proper dine-in restaurant where
            you can all go and enjoy different curries, but don’t forget to try their city-wide famous Korma!
        </p>

        <h2>10. Dahi Bharay</h2>
        <p>
            Dahi Bhara, otherwise known as Dahi Bhallay, is a yogurt-based snack with fried lentils dipped in them. You
            can put chaat masala on top and enjoy it. Again, quite famous in different markets where women stop to enjoy
            a quick bite during their shopping sprees.
        </p>
        <img src="/blog_portal/dhahi bhary.jpg" alt="">
        <p>
            he best dahi bhallay is probably by <strong>Ahmad Dahi Bhallay</strong> . It is located on the main road of
            Nishat Colony among many other branches in Lahore, and you can get as many plates as you’d like to enjoy the
            dish!
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h2>11. Gol Gappay</h2>
        <p>
            Gol Gappay, or Pani Puri, is yet another tempting and loved street food snack enjoyed by our Lahoris. It’s a
            light snack – fried shells filled with different foods, like chickpeas, potatoes, onions, imli ki chutney,
            etc., and is eaten by dipping it in meetha (sweet) or khata (bitter) paani.
        </p>
        <img src="/blog_portal/goll guppay.jpg" alt="">
        <p>
            While you can enjoy gol gappay at several different locations, you have to try them from <strong>Lahore
                Chatkhara</strong>. They are located in Johar Town, MM Alam Road, and even DHA.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h2>12. Tawa Chicken </h2>
        <p>
            A specially cooked chicken with green chilies and spices on top of a traditional “Tawa”, this dish is not
            for the faint of heart! Enjoying steaming hot off the Tawa with a thin roti or naan, Tawa Chicken is famous
            for its level of spice – so beware, or else you’ll regret it!
        </p>
        <img src="/blog_portal/tawa chiken.jpg" alt="">
        <p>
            <strong>Arif Chatkhara </strong>at Taxali Gate Road in the Walled City of Lahore has earned a name for
            itself for having the best Tawa Chicken in all of Lahore.
